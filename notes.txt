# Notes:

Issue: This system does not provide a way to find the birth time of a file.

-newerXY reference
  Compares the timestamp of the current file with reference.   The
  reference  argument  is  normally the name of a file (and one of
  its timestamps is used for the comparison) but it may also be  a
  string  describing  an  absolute time.  X and Y are placeholders
  for other letters, and these letters select which time belonging
  to how reference is used for the comparison.

  a   The access time of the file reference
  B   The birth time of the file reference
  c   The inode status change time of reference
  m   The modification time of the file reference
  t   reference is interpreted directly as a time

  Some combinations are invalid; for example, it is invalid for X to be t.  Some combinations are not implemented on all systems; for example B  is  not
  supported on all systems.  If an invalid or unsupported combination of XY is specified, a fatal error results.  Time specifications are interpreted as
  for the argument to the -d option of GNU date.  If you try to use the birth time of a reference file, and the birth time cannot be determined, a fatal
  error  message  results.   If  you  specify a test which refers to the birth time of files being examined, this test will fail for any files where the
  birth time is unknown.
